# Netpbm

[![Build status](https://github.com/JuliaIO/Netpbm.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JuliaIO/Netpbm.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

This package implements the
[FileIO](https://github.com/JuliaIO/FileIO.jl) interface for loading
and saving binary
[Netpbm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format) images.  Other
packages, such as
[ImageMagick](https://github.com/JuliaIO/ImageMagick.jl), also support
such formats. One advantage of this package is that it does not have
any binary (e.g., external library) dependencies---it is implemented
in pure Julia.
